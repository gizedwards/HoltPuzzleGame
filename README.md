# HoltPuzzleGame
This is based off of the show Brooklyn 99.
Captain Holt has a brainteaser; 
“There are 12 men on an island. 11 weigh exactly the same amount, but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier. You must figure out which. The island has no escapes, but there is a see-saw. The exciting catch? You can only use it three times.”
The idea of this code is to have 12 islanders, which you can click and drag onto the see saw, weigh them a maximum of 3 times. You then select the person who you think is the 'odd one out'. A pop up should appear when you answer saying correct or incorrect.
This is my first JavaScript solo coding thing.
I am terrible at design.
